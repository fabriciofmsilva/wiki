# Design

1. System architecture—The basic layout of the codebase. Rules that govern how various components, such as models, views, and controllers, interact with each other.
1. Maintainability—How well can the code be improved and extended?
1. Reusability—How reusable are the application’s components? How easily can each implementation of a component be customized?
